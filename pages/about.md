Hi, my name is Bohumír Zámečník and come from Czech republic. At present I'm working as machine learning engineer and researcher at [Rossum](https://rossum.ai/). We train ML models to extract data from invoices so that people don't have to spent time on that. I graduated in 2012 in Software Engineering (Computer Graphic) as MSc. at Charles University in Prague and since then I've been working at various positions in software engineering (web backend, big data, algorithmic trading, sound and image processing, machine learning).

While traveling across the world in 2016/2017 I've met my awesome wife. I like tinkering with software and hardware, building stuff, hiking, photography, music, riding a motorbike or exercising with kettlebell.
