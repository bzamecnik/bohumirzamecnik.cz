I'm a bit worried. Trying to work (with an IDE like Eclipse-based Android Development Tools) on a slow home computer is turning into a neverending painful waiting for the disk to stop rumbling... I was trying to work on porting the audio processing code, but with no tangible results. Today I'm really not sure if I'll be able to get anywhere before the MacBook arrives or I move to another computer beforehand. :(
	
On the other hand, a today's talk with my brother was far more productive. We've came up with three product ideas! Two e-books with tutorials in his area of expertise and a web application to link people for demand and supply of some kind of useful information.
