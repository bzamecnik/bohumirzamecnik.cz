    <h1>Bohumír Zámečník</h1>
    <p>How do things work? Ever since 1987 I've fallen in love with thinking about it. That's how I became a &raquo;digital craftsman&laquo;.</p>
    <p>
      After a life-time blessing and curse kiss by the first computer in 1993, after learning to think during a Computer Science MSc. at <a href="http://www.mff.cuni.cz/" title="Faculty of Mathematics and Physics - Computer Graphics">Charles University</a> and after getting in touch with freedom at work with wonderful people at <a href="http://etnetera.cz/">Etnetera</a> I realized I'm neither a narrowly specialized <a href="https://github.com/bzamecnik/" title="I hope someday I'll publish all my useful software">software engineer</a>, nor I don't want to be one.
    </p>
    <p>
      I day-dream a lot and I believe that &ldquo;the whole is greater than the sum of its parts&rdquo;. What defines me is embracing a wide spectrum of tools and interests that allow to envision a bigger picture. Then I've realized that most important problem is to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_Startup">learn</a> what the problem is. The rest are implementation details.

      Each month more people would like to <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/bohumirzamecnik" title="Now, after graduating, I can empathise into an attractive blond :)">hire me</a> than girls <a href="https://soundcloud.com/bohumir-zamecnik/coursera-jazz-04" title="If that happens then afterewards usually some music is produced as a result.">fell</a> in <a href="https://soundcloud.com/bohumir-zamecnik/coursera-jazz-imp-week1" title="...especially when a Jazz Improvization course is around. I didn't wait a while.">love</a> with me. If you're one, please be patient. I'm open to challenges but now the first thing on my TODO list is launching my own music-processing startup. Then I'll see what to do next.

      I love music. Both sharing the <a href="http://corale.cz/" title="Since high school I sing with great people in the Corale choir">emotions</a> with other people and <a href="http://harmoneye.tumblr.com/" title="I occassiaonlly write a blog about music theory">discovering</a> the gorgeous math theory behind. For the like visually-thinking people I'm crafting an <a href="http://harmoneye.com/" title="HarmonEye">application</a> that lets you utilize your eyes to see the harmony in music you're listening to, all the chords an tones, without clutter.

      Do you know you can photograph just with your eyes? Just look around you and see! The only drawback is that you couln't <a href="https://plus.google.com/112168593075061741028/photos">share</a> what you <a href="http://instagram.com/bzamecnik">see in your mind</a> with other people. Well, the other is that you couldn't be a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/elgriton">camera junkie</a>...
